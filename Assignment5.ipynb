These numbers are required for calculating the \"remainder\" which is the fraction of \"largest_number/smallest_number\". After calculating the remainder, the next step is repeating the division operation until the remainder becomes 0. It is done by verifying the condition if the remainder is not 0, then the divisor in the previous step i.e, the smallest_number is divided by the remainder obtained. This step is returned until the remainder becomes 0.\n",
